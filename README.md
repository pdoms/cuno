# Uni in C - merely an excercise

Trying to learn C. A card game seemed like a good excercise to do so.

## Plans:

- [x] set up project
- [ ] establish rudimentary gameplay  
- [ ] organize project structure  
- [ ] as cli game  
- [ ] add graphical user interface - either with game engine or as in browser game - maybe both

## Compile

```console

$ cc main.c -o cuno

```

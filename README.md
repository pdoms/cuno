# Uni in C - merely an excercise

Trying to learn C. A card game seemed like a good excercise to do so.

Plans:

[·] establish rudimentary gameplay
[·] organize project structure
[·] as cli game
[·] add graphical user interface - either with game engine or as in browser game - maybe both

```console

$ cc main.c -o cuno

```

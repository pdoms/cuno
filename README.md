# Uno in C - merely an excercise

Trying to learn C. A card game seemed like a good excercise to do so.

## Plans:

- [x] set up project
- [ ] establish rudimentary gameplay as cli game - by round
- [ ] organize project structure/error handling
- [ ] add tests [I was a bit overexcited at the beginning that I just played around and didn't write unit tests, don't like that]
- [ ] establish game bot strategies - not just highest valued card
- [ ] add graphical user interface - either with game engine or as in browser game - maybe both

## Compile

```console

$ cc main.c -o cuno

```
